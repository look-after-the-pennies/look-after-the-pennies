      <p class="mb-3">
        <i>TL;DR:</i> For budgetbanana.com visitors, we do not use cookies and
        we do not collect any personal data. If you subscribe to the mailing
        list your address is stored in a google sheet and only used for
        infrequent product announcement emails. If you decide to use the contact
        form, we only require your email address and perform no additional
        logging.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        At BudgetBanana, we are committed to complying with GDPR, CCPA, PECR and
        other privacy regulations on our website. The privacy of your data — and
        it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data
        is handled and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your
        data: never have, never will.

          We self-host the
          <a href="https://plausible.io">Plausible Analytics</a> script to
          collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal
          is to track overall trends in our website traffic, it is not to track
          individual visitors. All the data is in aggregate only. No personal
          data is collected.

      <p class="mb-3">
        Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration,
        information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and
        browser) used during the visit and more. You can see full details in

        As a subscriber to our mailing list
      </h2>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We only ask that you provide us with your email address and this email
        address will only be used to send infrequent product update e-mails. It
        will not be added to any other distribution lists or used in future to
        contact you regarding other matters.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        Currently we send an API call to an IFTTT web hook which saves your
        email address into a google sheet. Your email address is not stored in
        any other location and if you wish to unsubscribe your record will be
        deleted completely.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-xl mb-3 font-bold">As a user of our contact form</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We only ask that you provide us with your email address and this email
        address will only be used to reply to your message. It will not be added
        to a distribution list or used in future to contact you regarding other
        matters.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        For the form to work we need to send a request to a server operated by
        us but owned by Hetzner, a European company. On this server we do not
        log anything to do with your request but initiate sending an email to
        hello@speckledbanana.com using our email provider (currently Gmail).
      </p>

      <p class="mb-3">
        The only place that your email address is therefore stored is within our
        email inbox. Once we have dealt with your request and any follow up
        queries we will delete your correspondence.

      <h2 class="text-xl mb-3 font-bold">Changes and questions</h2>
